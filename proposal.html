    <h1>Project Proposal <span class="name">Alvin Jeong</span></h1>
    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Outside of school, <em>there aren’t really much learning opportunities that are free and community driven.</em> 
            Paid courses are abundant online such as <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/home">Skillshare</a> or 
            <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> but they are financially burdensome for some people especially if they 
            wish to learn a certain amount but are required to pay for a month of subscription. Even these are not really 
            focusing on “non-school” topics such as leather crafting or farming or what not. Also, deadlines and completions 
            often do help people to achieve more but sometimes they lead people away from learning out of pure interest. 
            After thinking about how I am subscribing to academic or informative subreddits on 
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> such as r/design, 
            r/programming, r/photography, etc, I thought that it’d be a great opportunity to provide the internet with free, 
            community driven, somewhat-casual learning environment that is based on crowdsourced information. 
            <em>Rather than leaving the internet limited in terms of learning in this information rich era, 
            I strongly feel the need of such an environment so that people can learn whatever they want, whenever 
            they want, free.</em></p> 
    <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p><em>Life-long learners, from people entering a new field of interest to experts wishing to develop their knowledge 
            and skills even more, will be using and benefitting from this app.</em> They will be able to select their fields 
            of interest and learning topics, learn at their own pace, and have access to a diverse web of information 
            thanks to an open crowd sourced environment for people to freely share information. 
            People will be able to access all sorts of information from any topics to learn about.
            This can be school academics such as chemistry, math, coding, or soft skills such as writing, car resume building 
            and writing, or even topics like religion, agriculture, e-sports, car maintenance, 
            anything with learning opportunities.</p>
        <p>Users can choose their own topics to subscribe to and sort of build their own “feed” of information 
            constructed with the topics they are learning at the moment. <em>Topics can be found through searching through 
            text input or through filters.</em> They will also be able to work their way to become a “verified tutor” 
            who is known to be knowledgeable in a certain area, benefiting from a point system or followers. 
            The profiles are relatively credible because they are “verified” and <em>people can look at 
            what information these people provided.</em></p>
        <ul>In short,
            <li>Anybody who wants to learn anything can use this application.</li>
            <li>People can search with text input, the topic they want to learn.</li>
            <li>People can view informations from "verified users" in their profile.</li>
            <li>People can scroll and view their learning feed with their topics of interests.</li>
            <li>People can post, comment, discuss, and engage with the learning community.</li>
        </ul>
